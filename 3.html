  The publication of this document by the W3C as a W3C
  Working Draft does not imply that all of the particip
  ants in the W3C HTML working group endorse the contents
  of the specification. Indeed, for any section of the specification,
  one can usually find many members of the working group or
  of the W3C as a whole who object strongly to the current text,
  the existence of the section at all, or the idea that the working
  group should even spend time discussing the concept of that
  section.
